  %\item The kernel determines which structures are likely under the \gp{} prior  
  %\item This prior determines the generalization properties of the model.
  %\item The kernel determines the pattern of generalization beyond the observed data
  \item For Gaussian process models, the prior --- and hence, the pattern of generalisation --- is determined by a kernel function. Common examples include:

\mysection{Automatically describing model properties}

\begin{itemize}
\item How to automatically describe complex kernels?
\begin{enumerate}
\item Break each kernel into a sum of products.
\item For each product, look up the properties of each kernel in that product.
\item Combine the properties into one sentence.
\item Plot contribution of this compoenent to the model.
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
%It is hard to write a lookup table to handle every kernel that the open-ended search might produce.  How to automate this?

%For a given dataset, the GPSS method produces a compound kernel composed of sums and products of the 6 base kernels.
%In this section, we describe how the properties of kernel functions reduce the task of natural-language summarization into relatively simple subproblems.

%\subsection{Summary}  
%\vspace{-0.08in}
%We have broken down the problem of describing arbitary compositions of kernels into two manageable parts.  First, we distribute the composite kernel into a sum of products.  Second, for each product of kernels, we describe the properties of products of kernels $\kSE$, $\kPer$, $\kC$ and $\kWN$, and then append descriptions of the properties of the modulating functions implied by products of $\kLin$ and $\kCP$.

\subsection*{Kernels can be distributed into a sum of products}

 
For example:
\begin{equation*}
\kSE \times \big( \kLin + \kLin \times ( \kPer + \kSE ) \big)
\end{equation*}
becomes
\begin{equation*}
(\kSE \times \kLin) + (\kSE \times \kLin \times \kPer) + (\kSE \times \kLin).
\end{equation*}

{ \color{red} [Insert a figure here showing an additive decomposition]}


\subsection*{Sums of kernels correspond to sums of functions}


If $f_1(x) \dist \gp{}(0, \kernel_1)$ and $f_2(x) \dist \gp{}(0, \kernel_2)$ then $f_1(x) + f_2(x) \dist \gp{}(0, \kernel_1 + \kernel_2)$.
Therefore, a sum of kernels can be described as a sum of independent functions.
%
%Thus, we can always exactly describe our model as a sum of these components, each of which is a product of base kernels.  The only remaining task is to produce a procedure for describing products of base kernels.

%\vspace{3\baselineskip}

\subsection*{Each kernel in a product corresponds to an adjective}


\vspace{1\baselineskip}

\centering
\begin{tabular}{l|l}
Kernel & How it modifies the prior \\
\midrule
$\SE$ & functions change smoothly \\
$\kPer$ & functions repeat \\
$\kLin$ & amplitude increases linearly
\end{tabular}

\vspace{1\baselineskip}

On its own, each kernel simply modifyies the constant function $f(x) = c$.



\subsection*{Example short descriptions}

\centering
\begin{tabular}{l|l}
Product of Kernels & Description \\
\midrule
$\kPer$ & An exactly periodic function \\
$\kPer \times \kSE$ & An approximately periodic function \\
$\kPer \times \kSE \times \kLin$ & An approximately periodic function with linearly varying amplitude \\
$\kLin$ & A linear function \\
$\kLin \times \kLin$ & A quadratic function \\
$\kPer \times \kLin \times \kLin$ & An exactly periodic function with quadratically varying amplitude\\
